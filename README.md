Our code is in the python notebook.

Required libraries: pandas, numpy, lightgbm, matplotlib

The code is not deterministic so results will slightly vary with every run.

This model was downloaded from our kaggle workspace and we only changed the paths for input and output.
This can also be run on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/arihant726/fork-of-team4notebook?scriptVersionId=64875008

The kaggle link also shows the history of our work and different versions submitted to the leaderboard. Version 6
was our last submission on the leaderboard and also the one with the best score.
